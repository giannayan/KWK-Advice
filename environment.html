<h1>Social Environment</h1>
 <p>Whether you're shy or nervous for the first day, we are here to prep you! This is a list of do's and don'ts.</p>
 <ol>DO socialize with people during lunch and in between class, find out about where they're from, what grade they're going into, what are they're hobbies? </ol>
 <ol>DON'T curl up into a ball pretending to be looking at your phone but really just looking at a turned-off phone and staring at yourself and your lonely soul :)</ol>
 <ol>DO ask for help if you you need help. The teachers and TAs are here to help you, also, don't be afraid to ask your peers! </ol>
 <ol>DON'T skip out on the games, the games are so fun, my favorite personally is WHAH, or WAA idk. But definiteley participate in them with your full energy.</ol>
